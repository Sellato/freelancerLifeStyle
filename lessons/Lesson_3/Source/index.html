					<span class='blue-color'>Days at La Granja</span> start early, when the gardens hang in mist and the
					cool dawn air fills with birdsong
					and the chirping of insects. Soon the farmers arrive. They feed the chickens and <span>a fat brown
						Iberian</span> hog
					named Coco. As the sun rises over <span>the pinewoods and aromatic fruit trees of Ibiza’s wild
						north,</span> the
					farmers begin to harvest the crops that will wind up in <span>La Granja’s kitchen</span>, where morning
					preparations
					are already underway. <br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="text navy-text">
					Since opening five years ago, La Granja, a <span style="color: #EA168E;">10-hectare
					</span> <br>biodynamic farmstead anchored by an
					18th-century stone <br>house, has become a polestar for a new and growing<br> movement on the Balearic
					island. Nodding to Ibiza’s<br> authentic hippie heritage and locally rooted vision of a<br> greener,
					slower
					future, today’s <span class='orange'>La Granja </span>is a laid-back<br> agroturismo <span>project that
						also</span> functions as a
					platform
					for<br>
					discourse on farming, sustainab<br>ility and our relationship with<br> the food we eat.
					<br><br>
					But the best way to understand La Granja is to begin, quite<br>
					literally, at the roots. We
					followed a
					selection of crops as<br> they made their way from soil to sustenance in a highly<br> sustainable,
					zero-waste process presented by the farmers,<br> cooks, critters and creative minds who make the
					farm
					what it<br> is today.

				<h2 class="title">1. CARROT</h2>

				<p class="descr">
					“As a farmer, there’s your tried and true varieties, where you know the flavor is good. But then I like
					to switch it up and experiment with different varieties that maybe are new on the scene or I've heard a
					friend use,” said Andy, who, as <span class='red-color'>the head farmer</span>, plans the crops for the
					coming seasons, pouring
					excitedly over the seed catalogs that arrive in November.</p>
				<img src="img/003-Carrot-Tumb-1000x870.jpeg" width="600" alt="carrot">
				<p class="descr green-text">
					“We have yellow, purple, orange carrots, which is really nice—so colorful,“ said <span>farmer Oscar de
						la
						Fuente of La Granja’s</span> varied crop of the root vegetable, which is grown together with beets,
					according
					to the wisdom of companion planting.
					<br>
					Chef Eduardo Fiaschi is a fermentation specialist.
					Though carrots are famous for their crunchy sweetness and packed punch of vitamins and minerals
					(especially beta-carotene, a compound that supports vision and eye health), the non-orange varieties are
					less known. Along with having lower sugar content, purple and <span class='yellow-carrots'>yellow
						carrots</span>, which actually predate
					their orange cousins, offer different nutrients, like lutein, which helps prevent macular
					degeneration.<br><br>

				<h2 class="title">2. HERBS</h2>

				<p class="descr">
					<span>Ibiza</span> is known for its proliferation of wild herbs, many of which now grow in La Granja’s
					herb garden.
					One of the best-loved and most frequently visited parts of the farm, it provides a constant supply of
					herbs for the kitchen and beyond. A few years ago, chef José Catrimán began using the herbs to make his
					own interpretation of Hierbas, a traditional Balearic aniseed liqueur made by extracting aromas of
					various plants that has its roots in monastic traditions dating back to the Middle Ages.
				</p>
				<img src="img/006-Herbs-Tumb.jpeg" width="600" alt="herbst">
				<p class="descr blue-descr">
					The process begins with the harvesting of a variety of Ibizan herbs, including chamomile, lemon verbena,
					orange and lemon leaves, a native wild thyme called fregola, oregano, sage, a wild mint called
					<span>hierbabuena</span> and even lemongrass. <br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="descr blue-descr">
					“This is my touch,” says José. “I put lemongrass in there and fennel flower, which gives a lot of flavor
					as well,” says the Patagonian chef, who also breaks from tradition when it comes to the alcohol he uses.
					“Usually hierbas is so sweet, because they use this aniseed liquor,” he explains. “But I like something
					more bitter.” <br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="descr">
					So he started to experiment with different gins and other alcohol, adding macerated herbs and letting it
					sit for months. <span>“I really found my recipe when I started to mix it with mezcal,”</span> says José,
					who also mixes some sweet and dry aniseed liquor into his recipe. <br><br>
				</p>

			<div id="p3" class="watermelon">
				<h2 class="title">3. WATERMELON</h2>

				<p class="descr">
					“Watermelons are a very typical Ibiza crop. They grow really well in this climate” said Andy. “I see a
					lot of the farmers on the Island getting two or three <span>successions</span> of watermelon plantings.
					And people
					love watermelon here, melons in general.”
				</p>
				<img src="img/012-Watermelon-Tumb-1000x870.jpeg" width="600" alt="watermelon">
				<p class="descr">
					In addition to the typical red variety, Andy trialed some yellow and <span class='orange'>orange</span>
					varieties of the hydrating
					summer fruit. “One thing about watermelons is when you harvest them, you have to harvest the whole
					field,” said Andy.br><br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="descr blue-descr">
					Otherwise, he continued, <span>“you have birds that come or rodents—some kind of pest will get them. So
						it's
						really interesting when we tell the kitchen, okay, our watermelons are ready, and then they have to
						figure out what to do with them. They have to get creative.”</span> <br><br>
				</p>

			<div id="p4" class="tomatoes">
				<h2 class="title">4. TOMATOES</h2>

				<p class="descr">

					“You think you know what is going to happen, but it's a surprise every time,” said farmer Sara, who
					heads the cultivation of La Granja’s tomato patch. “From very little plants, you prepare the field. You
					prepare the soil, then prepare the little houses for the tomatoes, hang all of them. It's a constant,
					constant work. And you can see the difference week by week."
				</p>
				<img src="img/011-Tomato-Tumb.jpeg" width="600" alt="tomatoes">
				<p class="descr blue-descr">
					“Everyone loves tomatoes. Everyone grows tomatoes,” says Andy, “but what I've chosen to do is grow some
					harder different varieties of heirloom tomatoes. The flavors of this one particular cherry tomato called
					Sungold, they're amazing. They out-flavor every tomato, so we grow the most of those.” <br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the most popular <span class='teal-color'>varieties of cherry tomatoes</span>, Sungold tomatoes
					ripen early to a golden orange,
					ready to harvest throughout the summer. Sweeter and longer-lasting than other cherry tomato varieties,
					they can be harvested twice a week once they begin producing fruit. <br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="descr coral-text">
					"From a little stem alone, then you'll have five, ten, and there are too many," said Sara. "So you have
					to choose. It’s kind of a game. You try to predict the future. Between those 10, we leave five. You bet
					that this is going to happen and maybe it's not. It’s a little bit <span>different</span> every
					week.”<br><br>

			<div id="p5" class="chili">
				<h2 class="title">5. CHILI</h2>
				<img src="img/002-Chilli-Tumb0.jpeg" width="600" alt="red chili">
				<p class="descr">
					There’s something of a local legend about the chili peppers at La Granja, linked to one of the farmers,
					Oscar de la Fuente, who moved to Ibiza four years ago from Guadalajara, Mexico, where he was born and
					raised. <br></p>


				<p class='text'>
					“We plant three types of chili, one that here they call the guindilla, then the serrano chili that
					is the spiciest, <span class='pink'>and then the jalapeño.</span> Normally the jalapeño is not very
					spicy, but all of them,
					they are so spicy,” said Oscar. "So our theory is that <span>how I planted them,</span> they recognize
					me
					and I
					recognize them, and all of them, they are fucking spicy!“
				</p>

				<p class='text text-yellow'>
					<br><br>
					Although the spiciness of the chiles means that they are generally consumed in small amounts, chilis
					(especially the mature red varieties) are rich in bioactive plant compounds with antioxidant
					properties, like capsanthin, a potentially cancer-fighting compound responsible for the chili’s red
					color, and spicy-hot capsaicin, which is believed to increase metabolism, burn fat and relieve
					topical pain. <br><br>

					To be slow is not merely to decrease the pace of life. It’s about taking the time to reconsider our

					“more
